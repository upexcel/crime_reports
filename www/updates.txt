app code
===========
1. in list view paging is artifical 
2. list view submit tip, share etc dont work
3. for share we can use social media etc but what URL to share?
4. api takes very long to respond, either use localStorage for caching or implement it at api level.
5. right now list view fires another api, instead store map view response in cache and use that itself


app refactor
==============
1. create service for ajax request (both controller and list_controller) have same ajax code.
also maybe we can use the data from map view itself
2. move image mapping to a different service
3. create lib/ folder
4. create service/ folder for each page
5. divide template/ folder also page wise and then divide different parts of a single page into multiple html files
6. setup nodejs for auto plugin update
7. setup requirejs
8. update ionic library
